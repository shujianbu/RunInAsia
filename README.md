RunInAsia
=========

This is a project created for The Wall Street Journal. After seeing projects that mapped the workout routes of residents in cities across Europe and the U.S., I felt like doing one for the cities in Asia. I grew up in Asia, where the faces of many cities are quite unique, due to their long histories and geographies. I thought this would be fun.
